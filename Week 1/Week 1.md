# Week 1 Notes

## Why computer Forensics?
- Important aspect of CyberSecurity
- Computers are either used as a tool to commit a crime or have become a target for these crimes

    - Computer Hacking 
    - Data theft
    - Terrorism
    - Murder
    - Fraud 
    - etc.

- encompasses any criminal act dealing with computers and networks

    - Hacking
    - DoS or DDoS attacks
    - Intrusion
    - Sending unsolicited or virus-causing electronic mail
    - Damage to or modifications of computer data or programs
    - Unauthorized access to computers and programs
    - etc.

- includes traditional crimes that are committed through the use of a **computer** and the **Internet**

    - Identity Theft
    - Data Theft
    - Internet Fraud
    - Counterfeit

## Objectives of Computer Forensics

- **Recover**, **analyse** and **present** computer based material to be presented as evidence
- Help to **identify** the evidence in a short time, **estimate** potential impact of malicios activity and **assess** the intent and identity of perpetrator



## Preservation

- Must preserve the **integrity** of the original evidence
- Original evidence should not be modified or damaged
- Make an image / copy of original evidence and perform the analysis
- Compare the copy with the original evidence to identify the modification or damages

### Evidence Preservation (Hashing)

- Compare hash values using either
    1. MD5
    2. SHA

## Identification

- Identifying the evidence and the location

## Extraction

- should be extracted immediately
- Volatile data can be lost at any point iin time
- extracted data compared with original and analyse

## Interpretation

- Most important for a Forensics Investigator
- Must be interpreted in a lucid (Clear) manner

## Documentation

- Maintained from the beginning of the investigation till the end

## What is Digital Evidence

- Found in hard disk drive, RAM, mobile phones, network or any external storage devices
- fragile and can be altered, damaged, or destroyed by improper handling or examination
- Failure to preserve the evidence may render it unusable or lead to an inaccurate conclusion, losing its credibility
- extremely important that the original evidence is acquired in a manner that **protects** and **preserves** the evidence
- probative information stored or transmitted in digital form that a party to a court case may use at trial
- Examples of digital evidences
    - Emails
    - Digital Photographs
    - Word processing documents
    - Instant message histories
    - Internet browser
    - histories
    - Content of Memory(RAM)

## Categories of Data

### Active Data
- Data that can be seen
    - Files and programs, data used by OS
    - Files in Recycle Bin

### Latent Data
- Data that exsists despite being deleted
    - specialised tool required

### Archival Data
- Data in backup
    - Stored in external devices

### Persistent Data
- Data stored in local hard drive and is preserved even when power is lost

### Volatile Data
- Data in memory that is lost when computer loses power
