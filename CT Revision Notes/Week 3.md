# Week 3 Notes

## Slack Space and RAM slack
- Unused space between the actual file and end of the defined data unit
- RAM slack is the space between the end of the actual file and the sector in which the file ends
    - the second is the remaining sectors in the `cluster that contain no data`.
    - It is also `OS dependent` but can either be untouched or wiped. 
    - In cases where the OS does not wipe the unused sectors, there will be `remnants` of the previous file that existed. An analysis of the slack space in this case could `expose sensitive information`. 

## Unallocated Space
- area or space on the hard drive of the computer that is available to write data to
- Not viewable to the typical computer user and requires specialized computer forensic software to view and analyze
- can contain deleted files or partially deleted files.  When a file is deleted, the `pointers` to the file are `removed`, but the `data remains in unallocated space` until such time as the `operating system stores another file` in the same space, thereby `over-writing the data`

## Allocated or Active Space
- area or space on the hard drive the contains the operating system and user data (files) that are easily accessible to the computer user
- File slack typically contains data that are part of the previous file or some random contents of memory, or both
- The tools and procedures to find evidence should include unallocated and slack space

## Evidence Examination
- extract and analyze digital evidence
    - generate a hash of the image copy of original media. The 2 hashes should agree before examination can proceed
    - Examination should be carried out on image copy to avoid tampering the original evidence
- `Extraction` refers to the recovery of data from its media. 
- `Analysis` refers to the interpretation of the recovered data and putting it in a logical and useful format.

## Types of extraction
- Manual Inspection
    - If the size of data to review is small
    - Used to validate results
    - Increase confidence in result
- File Signatures
    - file types may be renamed to disguise the actual file type
    - risky to just examine file extensions
- Timestamp and other metadata
    - Metadata includes full filenames, file sizes, MAC times, MD5 hashes, etc.
    - Searching can be based on last accessed or modified time.
    - Can search for known files by comparing MD5 and SHA-1 hash of file’s content with a hash database.
- String and Keyword searching
    - Based on file names and patterns in the file names.
    - Based on a keyword in their content 
    - certain conditions such as encoding or formatting can render a string search useless
- File carving
    - technique combines aspects of several methods
    - search for a unique sequence of bytes that corresponds with the header, or the first few bytes of a file 
    - Most common file formats have standardized header that marks the beginning of a file, and sometimes a footer that marks the end of the file.

## Analysis of extracted Data
- Understand what the suspect was doing
- Common analysis method
    - Time frame
        - Determine when the event occurred
        - Can associate usage of computer at the time of event
            - Review time and date stamps
            - Reviewing event logs
    - Data hiding
        - useful in detecting and recovering such data 
            - Identify mismatches of the file headers against the file extensions – presence of a mismatch indicates a malicious intent to conceal data.
        - Access all password-protected, encrypted, and compressed files – indicating that the illegitimate user has or tried to conceal the data from unauthorized users.
        - Steganography
    - Application and file
        - Inference from the files identified provide details such as the proficiency of the user.
        - We can infer the followings to identify details:
        - Reviewing file names for relevance and patterns
        - Examining file content
        - Co-relating the files to the applications installed on the target computer
        - Looking for similarities between the files. E.g. co-relating Internet history to cache files and e-mail files to e-mail attachments

## Collecting Evidence from Operating System
- Live system logs to collect
    - Web browsers
        - Browser may contain indirect evidence of specific crimes
            - Browser History
    - Chat logs
        - Criminal activities could be facilitated via chat-room discussions.
    - Event Logs
        - generated by system-wide auditing and monitoring mechanisms that are built in to Windows OS
        - Able to determine actions by user
        - Application
            - User Program or applications
        - System
            - events reported by a variety of core OS components.
        -Security 
            - Windows authentication and security processes 
        - Acquiring Windows event logs is a straightforward file acquisition task. 
        - Each log is stored in a separate file in paths specified within registry key
